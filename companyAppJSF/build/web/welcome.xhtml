       " We believe that we are on the face of the  
       earth to make great products and that's not 
       changing. We are constantly focusing on  
       innovating.We believe in the simple not the 
       complex.We believe that we need to own and 
       control the primary technologies behind the 
       products that we make,and participate only in  
       markets where we can make a significant contribution.  
       We believe in saying no to thousands of projects, 
       so that we can really focus on the few that are
       truly important and meaningful to us. We believe
       in deep collaboration and cross-pollination of
       our groups,which allow us to innovate in a way 
       that others cannot.And frankly, we don't settle
      for anything less than excellence in every group
                     in the company "</pre>
